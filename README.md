# Password Generator Tool 
This password generator tool was created using the Python programming language alongside the module of Tkinter for the GUI element of the application. 

When using the application, the password will generate a secure password of 13 characters in length which meets the following requirements:
 - At least one lowercase character
 - At least one uppercase character
 - At least one number

 The software can be ran using the .exe file found within the releases section of this repository, thank you.
